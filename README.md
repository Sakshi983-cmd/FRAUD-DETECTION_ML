# FRAUD-DETECTION_ML
ðŸš€ Fraud Detection Machine Learning Project This project is built as part of the GrowthLink internship task. It aims to detect fraudulent transactions using Machine Learning techniques.  Key Features:  Preprocessing of data for model training.  Model training using Logistic Regression (or other ML models if updated).  
# Fraud Detection Project

## Objective:
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using a **Random Forest Classifier**.

### Files Included:
1. **fraud_detection.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with the code to train and test the model.
2. **fraud_detection_model.pkl**: Trained model saved using `pickle` for future predictions.

### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine or open the Jupyter notebook directly.
2. Ensure that you have all the required libraries installed:
   - `pandas`
   - `sklearn`
   - `pickle`
3. Upload the training dataset `fraudTrain.csv`.
4. Run the `fraud_detection.ipynb` notebook to train the model.
5. The trained model will be saved as `fraud_detection_model.pkl`.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `sklearn`, `pickle`

### Evaluation Criteria:
- **Functionality**: How well the task is implemented.
- **Code Quality**: Structure, readability, and efficiency.
- **Innovation & Creativity**: Unique features or optimizations.
- **Documentation**: Clear explanation of the implementation.
